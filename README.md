---->Link Shortener Development

-->Project Overview
->This Java-based project is a fully-functional URL shortener application designed to shorten long URLs 

->into more manageable, compact links. The application leverages robust backend technologies to 

->ensure high performance, reliability, and scalability. The project includes features such as link 

->creation, redirection, analytics, and user authentication. The primary objective is to provide an easy-

->to-use and efficient service for generating shortened URLs.

-->Features

1.Link Creation: Users can input a long URL to receive a shortened version. The application

generates a unique, shortened link using an algorithm that ensures minimal collisions.

2.Redirection: When a user clicks the shortened URL, they are redirected to the original long URL. 

The redirection is handled efficiently to minimize latency.

3. Analytics: The application tracks and provides detailed analytics for each shortened URL,

including click counts, geographic data, and referring sites.

4. User Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in to manage their shortened URLs. This

feature includes secure user authentication mechanisms.


5. Custom Aliases: Users can customize their shortened URLs with preferred aliases, subject to

availability.

6. Expiration Dates: Users can set expiration dates for their shortened URLs, after which the links

will no longer be valid.
